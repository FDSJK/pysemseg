PySemSeg
========
 
PySemSeg is a library for training Deep Learning Models for Semantic Segmentation in Pytorch. 
The goal of the library is to provide implementations of SOTA segmentation models, with pretrained versions
on popular datasets, as well as an easy-to-use training loop for new models and datasets. Most Semantic Segmentation datasets
with fine-grained annotations are small, 
therefore Transfer Learning is will be a core capability of the library.
